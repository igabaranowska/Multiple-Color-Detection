# Multiple-Color-Detection
The main goal of the project was to write a script that would allow music to be played by detecting a specific color from the live camera. 

To run the project it is required:
-Download the SuperCollider application (if you want music to play. The program is not obligatory for the color detection itself)
-download Python programming environment FoxDot, library OpenCV 2 and library Numpy

To run the program just for color detection, you just need to compile the python code.
However, if you want to use the music part, you need to open the Supercollider application and then run the FoxDot.start command in it.
